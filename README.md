# Calculator
This project was completed for The Odin Project.<br>
Live Demo: http://jlbeans.github.io/Calculator<br>

During this project, I learned a lot about working with object literals.<br>
I initialized my calculator object at the start, and then referenced its <br>
properties in other functions to read and modify their values.
